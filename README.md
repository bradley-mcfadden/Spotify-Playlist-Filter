# Spotify-Playlist-Filter
An interactive terminal application that allows users to search through existing Spotify playlists and libraries
to build new playlists, or add results to an existing list.
Notably, it allows for filtering by genre, which the Spotify desktop app did not allow at the time.

## Usage

1) Set environment variables required by apps using the Spotify API:
```
SPOTIPY_CLIENT_ID = "my client id"
SPOTIPY_CLIENT_SECRET = "my client secret"
SPOTIPY_REDIRECT_URI = "my redirect uri"
```

2) Execute the application.
```
./pfilter.py
```
